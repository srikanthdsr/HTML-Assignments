	<p>Open source products include permission to use the source code,<a href=""><sup>[1]</sup></a>design documents,<a href=""><sup>[2]</sup></a> or content of the product. It most commonly refers to the <a href="">open-source model</a>, in which <a href="">open-source software</a> or other products are released under an <a href="">open-source license</a> as part of the <a href="">open-source-software movement</a>. Use of the term originated with software, but has expanded beyond the software sector to cover other <a href="">open content</a> and forms of <a href="">open collaboration</a>.</p>
